# Programming Project proposal (yet unnamed) Bob Oey

### Global summary
A public transportation app which offers live guidance to travellers unfamiliar with their surroundings. Instructions will include alerts to request a Stop, upcoming changes of vehicles etc.

### Description
For this project I intend to create a public transport (PT) assistance application. Current popular PT apps offer robust guidance, but lack in real-time assistance during the trip. This interaction gap is especially problematic for travellers unknown with the itinerary, such as tourists or simply people unknown with that specific route. Most notably, knowing when to prepare for leaving the vehicle or requesting a stop is often confusing. Real time PT data is available through the OpenOV api (http://openov.nl/) which already is essential for the user friendliness of modern day PT apps. Here I will empower environment-naive users with the comfort locals enjoy through their familiarity with their city by using their geolocation to track their PT vehicle and inform them of upcoming changes (e.g. Press Stop Now and exit your Tram # at the next stop).


### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

##### Alerting the user of upcoming exit movements will be main novel feature and as such forms the basis of the MVP, additional features may include: 

* Informing the user of the next step of their itinerary including directions from their exit to continue their route (e.g. Wait 3 minutes at #CURRENT_STOP and get in #NEXT_VEHICLE **or** Cross the street to the stop in the other direction). 
* Travel simulation
* Taking into account route mutations is the most advanced optional feature, where the itinerary could be adapted dynamically to changing circumstances such as delays or vehicle outage.


### Components

* Route planning interface (from / to)
* Map view to show route and current location
* Live route view (overview of upcoming changes)
* Background functionality (notifications)


### Required data sets and APIs

* Google Maps API
* Google Maps Directions API
* Google Places API (for Autocomplete, extra resource: https://github.com/watsonbox/ios_google_places_autocomplete)
* OpenOV API
* iOS Region Monitoring


### Possible difficulties

###### Power consumption
Power consumption issues could arise from continuous location monitoring. I don't know yet what the most efficient way of tracking the user would be. Using the user's location to check for nearness to the next stop may prove to be enough, but possibly not robust enough when there are other stops before the target stop. 
Once a user has boarded a vehicle and has verified this (?) it could be enough to poll the OpenOV data for the vehicle's position, making location irrelevant except for checking purposes.


###### Location precision
Inner city stops are often very close together, and coarse location data may not be accurate enough to offer solid advice. A combination of OpenOV/GMaps data should be used in these circumstances, but as this uses a lot of power it should not be the default way.
